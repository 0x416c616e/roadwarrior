# roadwarrior
## Inspiration
Took inspiration from the highly replicated pipe game. We also wanted to make a traffic simulator. 

Here is an early concept of the program:

## What it does
Verifies that you properly connected two roads on the map. Also randomly generates terrain. 

## How I built it
Using Intellij, Java, GIMP, etc. Used GitHub at first but eventually moved to Dropbox instead. Made on MacBooks.

## Challenges I ran into
Pathfinding algorithm, collaboration/merge conflicts (multiple people editing same files), algorithmic problem-solving, displaying well-made graphics.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It runs, solved a lot of the algorithms needed to make it register the user input correctly.

## What I learned
Iteration is sometimes better than recursion, how to draw graphics using JavaFX, debugging tool in IntelliJ, git is useful but complicated.

## What's next for Road Warrior
Obstacles and limitations to make it more challenging

##Note
Will did a lot of the code, but it shows up as a contribution by Alan because we didn't do the entire project on GitHub. However, both Will and Alan did a lot on it. We just didn't use GitHub for the entire project so it doesn't reflect who did what.
